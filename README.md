## About This Project

This was an assignment for a senior level [data mining course](https://academic-calendar.wlu.ca/course.php?c=50474&cal=1&d=1903&s=897&y=77). The goal of this assignment was to practice exploratory data analysis and also get an understanding of the K-means clustering algorithm on the well known [iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris).
